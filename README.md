# Tourism Employment and GDP Contribution

#### Mini Project — PSY6422 Data Analysis & Visualisation

This project explores the relationship between **tourism employment** and **tourism-related contribution to GDP** across multiple countries over time. The analysis aims to understand how economic dependence on tourism aligns with labour patterns in tourism-related industries.

The datasets used in this project originate from **Our World in Data** (<https://ourworldindata.org/>), containing yearly estimates of: - Number of individuals employed in tourism-related industries per 1000 people\
- Tourism GDP as a proportion of total GDP

Both datasets are publicly accessible and provide consistent, comparable measures across countries.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project investigates:

1.  **How tourism employment changes across different countries over time**\
2.  **Whether higher GDP reliance on tourism predicts higher employment in tourism-related industries**\
3.  **Which regions show the strongest tourism dependence**\
4.  **Visual comparisons of employment trends and GDP contribution trends**

The project includes: - Data cleaning and tidying\
- Exploratory visualisations using ggplot2\
- Correlation analysis\
- Multi-panel comparisons\
- A final combined storyline published through GitHub Pages

## 📁 Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from the following publicly available datasets:

-   *Number of individuals employed in tourism-related industries per 1000 people*\
    Source: Our World in Data\
-   *Tourism GDP proportion of total GDP*\
    Source: Our World in Data

Both datasets have been cleaned and stored in the repository under the `/Data` folder.

## 🗺 Visualisations in This Project

The project includes: - A line graph comparing tourism employment across selected countries\
- A line graph showing GDP proportion over time\
- A faceted comparison showing trends side-by-side\
- A combined plot highlighting tourism-dependent economies

All graphs are generated using R and can be found in the `/Plot` folder.
